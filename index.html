      Hello. My name is Emma. I wanted to use this website to share my art and
      my journey through creating and developing a name for myself. I want to be
      able to help others start their businesses. I enjoy creating logos and
      have had 6 years of experience in Photoshop and Illustrator. On this
      Website I am going to share 3 of my hobbies. My first is my Graphic Design
      artwork and a little bit about how I go into Graphic Design. The second
      page is a hobby I picked up over the summer, whic is crocheting. Finally,
      my last page is Vinyl because I have been making serval art pieces using
      different types of vinyl.
