      This summer I took up a new hobby. I have wanted to learn how to crochet
      for a long time but never had a chance to sit down and learn. This year me
      and my friend Mary wanted to learn to crochet and attend a craft show with
      our creations. I started with making cup cozies and have worked my way up
      to making scarfs, gloves, and hats. My current project is makibng myself a
      blanket. There are several ways to crochet, I use single crocheting. There
      is double crocheting, triple, ect. I am looking forward to learn more
      about the world of croceting and create new peices.
